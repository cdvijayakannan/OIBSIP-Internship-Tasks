# OIBSIP-Internship-Tasks
TASK 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data
Description:

In this project, you will work with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can
help the retail business make informed decisions.

Key Concepts and Challenges:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.


Learning Objectives:

Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
Develop skills in interpreting descriptive statistics and time series analysis.
Learn to use data visualization for effective communication of insights.

#TASK 2:Wine Quality Prediction

Description:
The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a
real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset
encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the
features for three distinct classifier models.

Key Concepts and Challenges:

Classifier Models: Utilizing Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support
Vector Classifier (SVC) for wine quality prediction.
Chemical Qualities: Analyzing features like density and acidity as predictors for wine quality.
Data Analysis Libraries: Employing Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for array
operations.
Data Visualization: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing patterns and insights in the
dataset.
